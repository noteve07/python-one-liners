# Python One-liners
no semicolons ;)

These are the codes that I wrote for fun at the end of my 11th Grade. No practical use, but it improves my thinking back then, familiarizing myself further on python syntax. It was very fun!

# 🐍 Python One-Liners

Welcome to **Python One-Liners**!  
This repository is a collection of concise, clever, and occasionally quirky Python one-liner scripts I wrote for fun during the end of my 11th grade. While most have little practical use, they were a great way to boost my problem-solving skills and deepen my understanding of Python syntax.

## 🚀 What You'll Find

- Short, often single-line, Python scripts and tricks
- Creative uses of Python syntax, built-ins, and libraries
- A playground for learning, experimenting, and thinking outside the box

---

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each one-liner is typically found in its own file, or grouped in scripts with explanations as comments (where necessary).

---

## 🧑‍💻 Example

```python
# Reverse a string
s = "hello"
print(s[::-1])  # Output: 'olleh'
```

---

## 🤔 Why One-Liners?

- To challenge myself to write the shortest possible code for a task
- To better understand Python's expressive power
- For fun and learning!

---

## 💡 Inspiration

These scripts were inspired by coding challenges, sololearn community, curiosity, and a desire to explore the limits of Python.
